# One Million Divs

Vision - we display all divs all at once.
We need to solve the slow part

## Challenges:

 - too many divs to render ( make browser slow )
 - storage and retreival ( chunk the data 5K chunks ) 
 - compression ( bitmap binary )

## Features

 - 
 - color theme / colors
 - multi user - so we can all modify each div bg color
